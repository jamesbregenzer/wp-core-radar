# Scoring Rubric

WP Core Radar uses deterministic scoring before any human or AI-assisted review. The goal is to surface WordPress Core tickets that are likely to be actionable, useful, and aligned with repeatable contribution work.

The source of truth for scoring is `score_ticket()` in `scripts/radarlib.py`. This document mirrors that implementation so the public repo is reviewable without reading the code first.

## Baseline Track Priority

Every enabled query in `config/queries.json` has a `priority` value. That value becomes the ticket's starting score before ticket-level signals are added.

Current enabled tracks:

| Query slug | Display name | Baseline |
|---|---|---:|
| `media_has_patch` | Media: Has Patch | +100 |
| `accessibility_has_patch` | Accessibility: Has Patch | +95 |
| `docs_needs_testing` | Docs: Needs Testing | +75 |
| `good_first_bugs` | Good First Bugs | +70 |
| `general_needs_testing` | General: Needs Testing | +65 |

Unknown archived datasets fall back to a baseline of +50.

## Freshness, Momentum, and Ticket Age

Freshness, momentum, and ticket age are scored separately and shown as explicit score details in the dashboard/admin payload. This keeps the scoring explainable enough for review decisions such as `Freshness: Recently updated <=14 days +20`, `Momentum: Healthy comment count +7`, or `Ticket age: Very old ticket -8`.

- **Freshness** is based on the ticket's `modified` or change time. It answers: has this ticket moved recently?
- **Momentum** is based on the comment count. It answers: does the ticket have enough discussion to be actionable without becoming a huge thread?
- **Ticket age** is based on the ticket's `created` date. It answers: is the ticket mature enough to have context, or so old that it may need extra caution?

A ticket can be old but still receive a freshness boost when it was recently updated. A mature ticket can receive a small ticket-age boost, while a very old ticket can be penalized if age suggests extra risk.

Freshness and ticket-age signals depend on Trac CSV fields such as `time`/`Created` and `changetime`/`Modified`. Browser-fetch requests those columns explicitly, and the parser accepts both ISO-style timestamps and Trac's AM/PM CSV timestamps such as `04/23/2026 03:37:20 PM`.

Momentum scoring depends on a usable comment-count column. Browser-fetch requests likely comment-count aliases (`comments` and `_comments`), and the scorer also recognizes stored aliases such as `comment_count` and `Comment Count`. If Trac does not return one of those fields for a query, momentum is omitted rather than guessed.

## Positive Ticket Signals

| Signal | Points | Source |
|---|---:|---|
| Has patch | +35 | `keywords` contains `has-patch` or `has patch` |
| Needs testing | +30 | `keywords` contains `needs-testing` or `needs testing` |
| Good first bug | +20 | `keywords` contains `good-first-bug` or `good first bug` |
| Media component | +20 | `component` is `Media` |
| Accessibility signal | +18 | component or keywords mention accessibility |
| Dev feedback | +18 | `keywords` contains `dev-feedback` or `dev feedback` |
| Reporter feedback | +10 | `keywords` contains `reporter-feedback` or `reporter feedback` |
| Freshness: recently updated <=14 days | +20 | modified/change time |
| Freshness: updated within 60 days | +10 | modified/change time |
| Ticket age: mature but not ancient | +8 | created date is 30–730 days old |
| Concrete milestone | +8 | milestone is present and not `Awaiting Review` or `Future Release` |
| Momentum: healthy comment count | +7 | 2–20 comments |
| Has owner | +6 | owner exists and is not `anonymous` or `nobody` |

## Negative Ticket Signals

| Signal | Points | Source |
|---|---:|---|
| Closed or non-actionable status | -100 | status is `closed`, `fixed`, `wontfix`, `duplicate`, or `invalid` |
| Already produced props | -60 | `data/outcomes/outcomes.csv` records `props` |
| Already tested | -20 | `data/outcomes/outcomes.csv` records `tested` |
| Freshness: stale activity >2 years | -10 | modified/change time older than 730 days |
| Missing summary | -10 | summary field is empty |
| Ticket age: very old ticket | -8 | created date older than 3650 days |
| Momentum: very large thread | -8 | more than 80 comments |

## Priority Target Rules

A ticket appears in **Priority Targets** only when all of these are true:

1. It has no existing review decision.
2. Its score is at least 150.
3. It has at least one action signal: `needs testing`, `has patch`, or `good first bug`.
4. It has at least one manageability signal: ``freshness`, `momentum`, or `has owner`.
5. It does not include stale or already-acted-on penalties such as `very old ticket`, `stale activity`, `very large thread`, `already produced props`, or `already tested`.

Only the first 12 matching tickets are shown as Priority Targets.

## Review Grouping

Review decisions live in `data/reviews/reviews.json` and move tickets into workflow sections:

| Review status | Section |
|---|---|
| `shortlist` | Shortlisted |
| `watch` | Watching |
| `tested`, `commented`, `props`, `committed` | Completed / Acted On |
| `reject` | Rejected |
| no review status | Priority Targets or Top Opportunities |

## Guardrail

Scores are recommendations only. WP Core Radar does not auto-comment on Trac or perform contribution activity. A human reviewer opens the ticket, verifies current state, tests locally where appropriate, and decides what to do next.
